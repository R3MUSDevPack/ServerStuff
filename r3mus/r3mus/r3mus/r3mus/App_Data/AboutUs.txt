Raised By Wolves Inc is a dedicated PVP corporation that combines the experience of the veteran with the enthusiasm of new pilots to EVE. Our members receive ample opportunity to join a variety of fleet actions and styles in an environment that fosters fun, learning, and explosions.

Lots. Of. Explosions. 

The best fleets are supported fleets, and that means good comms, great doctrines, and fantastic training. While freeing the enemy from the confines of their ship is our speciality, first and foremost we are a community that values maturity, patience, humour, and teamwork. Skill points come with time, but good attitude is priceless.

If any of the above sounds like your kind of internet spaceship game, head over to
